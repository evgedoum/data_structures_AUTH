# Maze Game with Theseus and Minotaur

**Course**: Data Structures  
**University**: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)  
**Semester**: 3rd Semester (2020-21)

## Overview
This project is a console-based game where Theseus collects supplies while avoiding the Minotaur. The game is developed using data structures and the Minimax algorithm to optimize Theseus' movements. It is implemented in Java and consists of three main parts:

- **Part A**: Setup of the game board, placement of walls, and supplies. Also includes random movement for the Minotaur.
- **Part B**: Implementation of the Minimax algorithm to make Theseus' movements strategic.
- **Part C**: Complete game logic with rounds, board visualization, player moves, and a detailed game summary.

## Gameplay
- Theseus starts at position `(0, 0)` and tries to collect all supplies while avoiding the Minotaur.
- Minotaur starts at the center of the board and moves randomly.
- The game ends when:
  - Theseus collects all supplies.
  - Minotaur catches Theseus.
  - The game reaches 100 rounds, resulting in a draw.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed.
